This course uses node version 14 - specifically 14.17.6.

This course uses the Firebase Web NPM Package version 8.1.1 (version 8).
In September 2021 Firebase released version 9 of the Firebase Web NPM Package that has greater support for tree-shaking optimization (to reduce bundle size). However, version 8 is still fully documented and supported and will be maintained for quite some time.
